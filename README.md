We have recently adopted GitHub Enterprise at [Auto Trader](http://www.autotrader.co.uk/) and it has been interesting thinking about how the GitHub teams functionality maps to our delivery squads ([wtf?](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1018963/Articles/SpotifyScaling.pdf)).

I was also reading about the sad history of the [Chernobyl Liquidators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidator_%28Chernobyl%29), and the [badge](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3AM%C3%A9daille_Tchernobyl_goutte_de_sang.jpg) that was awarded reminded me of 
the inbox zero badge I occasionally see on Twitter. This made me think about how it would be nice to be able to recognise people’s contributions to projects and initiatives using badges displayed on their GitHub profile.

This could be achieved currently using GitHub Organisations, and setting the avatar of the Organisation to the image you would like to associate with the badge, but I think that’s probably misusing the Organisation functionality and needlessly difficult to administer.

This could potentially develop into custom stickers, allowing you to show off your badges to the world. Everybody loves stickers, right?

There are existing services set up around this functionality, such as [OpenBadges](http://openbadges.org/) and [Coderwall](https://coderwall.com/), but neither integrates deeply with GitHub (although Coderwall will use the GitHub Organisation approach mentioned above).
